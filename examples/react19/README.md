# Example of using Confidence in React 19

This is a barebones client-side React 19 app using Vite, with no server-side rendering or extra tooling.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

## Notes

- Uses @spotify-confidence/react and @spotify-confidence/sdk from the monorepo.
- No SSR, no testing libraries, no extra tooling.
